In this workshop you are going to learn how to prove documents existed prior to certain point in time. This document could be any digital file you can imagine in which you have an interest to notarize 
— for example a meaningful contract, a movie script or a patent.

After completing the workshop, you will be able to:

- Distinguish common strategies to notarize documents in blockchain.
- Identify different uses for NEM accounts.
- Modify the blockchain state by announcing transactions.

Based on the [Apostille Whitepaper](https://nem.io/wp-content/themes/nem/files/ApostilleWhitePaper.pdf). Apostille defines how to make transferable, updatable, branded, and co-owned notarizations on NEM blockchain.
